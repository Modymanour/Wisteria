The website is solo developed by Mohamed Mansour and it aims to provide an experience solely based on art and music. I truly think in this day and age that we involve ourselves with too much discord and distractions exists to keep us sedated. When I find myself in that state, I love to redicert my energy into music and art and they have been a warm sanctuary in which I can reside, and my hope is that I can share the sacntuary with y'all.
